# Liquidation Searcher

Orderly liquidations TPS scale with number of liquidators, so we implement an open source liquidator bot to make it easier to let other traders join the liquidation party.

**WARNING: The bot is not fully tested! Use at Your Own Risk!**

This project contains two parts:

* A real-time async event-driven trading framework heavily inspired by [paradigmxyz/artemis](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/artemis).
* A liquidation searcher that uses the framework to search for liquidation opportunities.

You can read more details from the [docs](/docs)

```

## Configurations

The configurations contain two parts, you can refer to the example files:

plaintext config: [staging.yml](/conf/staging.yml)

```yaml
app:
  level: "INFO"
  port: 8088 # health check port
orderly:
  account_id: '' # your account id
  rest_endpoint: 'https://testnet-api-evm.orderly.org'
  ws_public_endpoint: 'wss://testnet-ws-evm.orderly.network/ws/stream/'
  ws_private_endpoint: 'wss://testnet-ws-private-evm.orderly.network/v2/ws/private/stream/'
  max_notional: 1000 # max notional of each liquidation claim, it already includes the leverage, should be greater than min notional of the liquidated type claim
  liquidation_symbols: ['PERP_BTC_USDC', 'PERP_ETH_USDC', 'PERP_NEAR_USDC', 'PERP_WOO_USDC'] # liquidation symbols whitelist
```

secret config: [.envrc.example](/.envrc.example)

```sh
export ORDERLY_KEY=
export ORDERLY_SECRET=
```

## Run on local machine

The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies and virtualenv.

```sh
# Required python >= 3.10, you may use asdf or pyenv to manage multiple python versions
pip install poetry
poetry install # install all dependencies in the virtualenv
poetry shell # spawn a shell within the virtual environment
# run it in company's vpn in qa environment or use the staging environment
# source secret envs from your .env file
python src/liquidation_searcher/main.py -c conf/staging.yml
```

## Run with systemd

Reference the systemd unit file [liquidation_searcher_dev.service](/deployment/liquidation_searcher_dev.service)

## Run with docker or k8s

Reference the [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile), Note that you need to set the environment variables in the dockerfile or pass them in when running the container in k8s
